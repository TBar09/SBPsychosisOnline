# Friday Night Funkin': Spongebob's Psychosis - Online data
This repository stores all of the online data for FNF Spongebob's Psychosis!

This is specifically for changing data on the fly without having to release
small updates to the mod for minor bug fixes.

this also stores the version code, so Spongebob's Psychosis can detect if your
using the most recent version of the mod and notifies you on the menu when you
need to update.

(disable "Check for Updates" in the Options menu to not get notified of new
major updates)

this code is really nothing to write home about, or to fork, so its best to 
leave it be.
