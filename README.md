# SBPsychosisVersion
This is the file that checks the mod's current and recent update version.

if the Mod has had a major update, like V1 or V2 or something like that, then the file
here will change to the most recent version!

the game will then check the version on here and compare it to the game's version, and if
they aren't matching, then it will come out as true.

this code is not really anything to fork or whatever, best to leave it be
